# **Chapter 3 - The Basic Tools**

## **Shell Games**

Benefit of GUI IDE Interfaces - ***WYSIWYG*** *What you see if what you get*
Disadvantage of GUI IDE Interfaces - ***WYSIAYG*** *What you see is all you get*

>* **Use the Power of command Shells**

Gain familiarity with the shell, and you'll find your productivity soaring.

## **A shell of you own**

*As the woodworkers customize their workspace, the programmers should customize their shell*

Common changes:
1. *Setting color themes*
2. *Configuring a prompt* - Prompt that shows when your shell is ready for you to type command and use it.
3. *Aliases and shell functions* - Turn commands that you use a lot into simple aliases
4. *Comand completion* - Take the Tab autocompletion to much further for full commands.

*You are gonna spend a lot of time in shell, make it your home.*

## **Power Editing**

Use as many editors you want, but work towards fluency in each

> **Achieve Editor Fluency**

*Just by making your editing 4% more faster and if you edit for 20 hours a week, you can get an extra week.*

In Fluency, your thoughts will flow and your programming will benefit.

### **What does "Fluent" Mean?**

Challenges that you will do, you will be fast editor:

- When editing text, move and make selections by character, word, line, and paragraph.
- When editing code, move by various syntactic units (matching delimiters, functions, modules,...).
- Reindent code following changes.
- Comment and uncomment blocks of code with a single command.
- Undo and redo changes.
- Split the editor window into multiple panels, and navigate between them.
- Navigate to a particular line number.
- Sort selected lines.
- Search for both string and regular expressions, and repeat previous searches.
- Temporarily create multiple cursors based on a selection or on a pattern match, and edit the text at each in parallel.
- Display compilation errors in the current project.
- Run the current projects's tests.

### **Moving towards Fluency**

You cannot know all the commands in a IDE, but everytime you find yourself doing something repetitive, you must ask yourself "There must be a better way for this".

Once you discover a new feature, consciously look for opportunities to use the new superpower cause at start you will not remember that you have new superpower.

### **Growing your editor**

Dig into your editor's extension language.Work out how to use it to automate some of the repetitive things you do. Often you'll just need a line or two of code.

Sometimes you might take it further still, and you'll find yourself writing a full blown extension. If so, publish it: If you had a need rot it, other people will too.

## **Version Cntrol**

### **It starts at source**
With a properly configured source code control system, you can always go back to a *previous version* of your software.

> **Always use Version Control**

### **Branching out**
You can create a branch at any point in your project's history, and any work you do in that branch will be isolated from all other branches. Multiple people can even by working on a branch; ina way, branches are like little clone projects.

## **Debugging**

### **Psychology of debugging**

> **Fix the problem not the blame**

It doesn't really matter whether the bug is your fault or someone else's. It is still your problem.

### **A debugging mindset**

Before you start debugging. It's important to adopt the right mindset, turn off many of the defenses you use each day to protect your ego, tune out any project pressures you may be under, and get yourself comfortable.

> **Don't Panic**

Don't waste a single neuron on the train of thought that begins "but that can't happen". Resist the urge to fix just the symptoms you see. Always try to discover the root cause of a problem, not just this particular appearance of it.

### **Where to start**

- Before you start to look for the bug, make sure that you are working on code that built cleanly - without warnings.
- You can't afford to waste time debugging the coincidences, you first need to be accurate in your observation.
- You may actually need to watch the user to get the sufficient level of detail.

### **Debugging strategies**

**Reproducing Bugs**

The best way to start fixing a bug is to make it reproducible.

But we want more than a but that can be reproduced by following some long series of steps; we want a bug that can be reproduced with a single command.
