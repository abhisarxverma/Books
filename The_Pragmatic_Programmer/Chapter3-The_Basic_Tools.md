# **Chapter 3 - The Basic Tools**

## **Shell Games**

Benefit of GUI IDE Interfaces - ***WYSIWYG*** *What you see if what you get*
Disadvantage of GUI IDE Interfaces - ***WYSIAYG*** *What you see is all you get*

>* **Use the Power of command Shells**

Gain familiarity with the shell, and you'll find your productivity soaring.

## **A shell of you own**

*As the woodworkers customize their workspace, the programmers should customize their shell*

Common changes:
1. *Setting color themes*
2. *Configuring a prompt* - Prompt that shows when your shell is ready for you to type command and use it.
3. *Aliases and shell functions* - Turn commands that you use a lot into simple aliases
4. *Comand completion* - Take the Tab autocompletion to much further for full commands.

*You are gonna spend a lot of time in shell, make it your home.*

## **Power Editing**

Use as many editors you want, but work towards fluency in each

> **Achieve Editor Fluency**

*Just by making your editing 4% more faster and if you edit for 20 hours a week, you can get an extra week.*

In Fluency, your thoughts will flow and your programming will benefit.

### **What does "Fluent" Mean?**

Challenges that you will do, you will be fast editor:

- When editing text, move and make selections by character, word, line, and paragraph.
- When editing code, move by various syntactic units (matching delimiters, functions, modules,...).
- Reindent code following changes.
- Comment and uncomment blocks of code with a single command.
- Undo and redo changes.
- Split the editor window into multiple panels, and navigate between them.
- Navigate to a particular line number.
- Sort selected lines.
- Search for both string and regular expressions, and repeat previous searches.
- Temporarily create multiple cursors based on a selection or on a pattern match, and edit the text at each in parallel.
- Display compilation errors in the current project.
- Run the current projects's tests.

### **Moving towards Fluency**

You cannot know all the commands in a IDE, but everytime you find yourself doing something repetitive, you must ask yourself "There must be a better way for this".

Once you discover a new feature, consciously look for opportunities to use the new superpower cause at start you will not remember that you have new superpower.

### **Growing your editor**

Dig into your editor's extension language.Work out how to use it to automate some of the repetitive things you do. Often you'll just need a line or two of code.

Sometimes you might take it further still, and you'll find yourself writing a full blown extension. If so, publish it: If you had a need rot it, other people will too.
