# **Chapter 1Ô∏è‚É£ - A Pragmatic Philosophy** üÉè

## **Software Entropy**

### **A Broken window ü™ü - (Psychological study on abandoned houses)** 

> *One broken window, left unrepaired for any subsrtantial length of time, instills in the inhabitants of the building a sense of abandonment - a sense that the powers that be don't care about the building.So another windoew gets broken. And this continue till abandonment.*  

### **üìù Prevent SOFTWARE ROT - Don't live with Broken Windows**

- Don't leave **broken windows** (bad designs, wrong decisions, poor code) unrepaired.
- Fix as soon as one is found.
- If insufficient time, then comment out the offending code with ***NOT IMPLEMENTED*** message

#### First Do Not Harm

- While trying to fix the broken windows in the code, you better not damage the clean code, cause one broken window is one too many.

- Take extra care to keep the working code secure and then go for fixing the broken windows.

## üç≤ **Stone Soup And Boiled Frogs** 

> *You maybe in a situation where you know what needs to be doing and how to do it, but seeking approval for everybody to contribute into that will take many delays.*

### **Bring Out Stones - Start yourself** 

- Work out what you can reasonably ask for.
- Develop it well.
- Once done show it to people and pretend it's not important.
- Sit back and wait for them to start aksing you to add the functionality
- People find it easier to join on ongoing success.

#### The Villages'side

> *Many times the developers keep on adding the things to the code like the villagers because of which Systems drift from their specifications feature by feature, while patch after patch gets added to a piece of code until there's nothing of the original left.*

### üê∏ **The Boiled Frog - Remember the Big Picture** 

Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what's happening around you, not just what you personally doing.

## **Good Enough Software**

Discipline yourself to write the softwares that are good enough - good enough for users, for future maintainers, for your own peace of mind.

You will become productive and make your users happy.

Good Enough means systems must meet their user's requirements to be successful, and meet basic performance, privacy, and security standards.

### **Make Quality a Requirements Issue** üìÉ

> *Surprisingly, many users would rather use software with some rough edges today than wait a year for the shiny, bells-and-whistles version. Give your users to play with early, their feedback will often lead you to be a better eventual solution.*

#### Know when to stop

- Programming is like painting, but artists tell you that all the hard work is ruined if you don't know when to stop.

- If you add layer upon layer, detail over detail, the painting becomes lost in the paint.

- ***Don't do overembellishment and overrefinement on a perfectly good program***. Let your code stand in it's own right for a while.

## üß† **Your Knowledge Portfolio** 

> *Your knowlege are *expiring assets*. It becomes out of date as new techniques, languages and environments developed. Changing market forces may render your expeirience obsolete or irrelevant. **Your ability to learn new things is the most important strategic asset**.

### üìÅ **Building your portfoilo** 

1. ***Inverst regularly*** - Lean Regularly
2. ***Diversify*** - The face of computing changes rapidly. The more techonologies you are comfortable with, the more you are comfortable to change.
3. ***Manage risk*** - Don't put all your technial eggs in one basket. Manage between the high risk and low risk skills.
4. ***Buy low, sell high*** - Learning an emerging technology, before it becomes popular can be risky but rewarding.
5. ***Review and rebalance*** - This is a very dynamic industry, brush up on the new ways of doing the things you do.

### ‚òëÔ∏è **Goals** 

1. ***Learn at lest one new language every year*** - Broaden your thinking and help you avoid getting stuck in the rut.
2. ***Read a technical book each month*** - Read technical books on interesting topics related to your current project.
3. ***Read non-technical books also*** - You are acquired by the people and get hacked by the people, Soft skills is the human side of equation.
4. ***Take classes*** - Look for interesting courses at a local or online college or university.
5. ***Participate in local user groups and meetups*** - Isolation can be deadly to your career. Go out and participate in what people are workign on outside of your company.
6. ***Experiment with different environments*** - If you have worked in windows, spend some time with Linux.
7. ***Stay current*** - Read news and posts online on technology different from that of your current project.

**Cross Pollination of Ideas are Important**.
*It doesn't matter whether you use these skills or knowledge in your resume. The process of learning will expand your thinking, opening you to new possibilites and new ways of doing things.*

### **Opportunities For Learning**

Time is already in the short supply. Always have something to read in an otherwise dead moment.

But do not believe everything you read and hear.

#### ü§î Critically Analyze What You Read And Hear

- *Ask the "Five Whys"* - Continue asking the "Why" for at least five times to get a clear idea.
- *Who does this benefit?* - The benefits fo someone else or another organization may be aligned with your own, or not.
- *What's the context?* - EVerything occurs in it's own context?. So if you see "*best parctice*", ask "*best for who*".
- *When or Where would this work?* - Don't stop with the first-order thinking *(what will happen next)*, but use second-order thinking *(What will happen after that)*.
- *Why is this a problem?* - How does the underlying model work?
