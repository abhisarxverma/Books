# 📚 Books : Journal For My Programming Books Reading

This repository is a personal notebook where I document the key ideas, patterns, and practical lessons from the most influential books I’m reading as I grow as a backend developer and programmer.

I don’t aim to summarize every paragraph, but to highlight what shaped my thinking, helped me write better code, or changed how I approach problems.

## 📖 Books Covered

- [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)
- [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/)
- [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
- More to be added...

## Each markdown file contains:
    - ✅ Actionable insights
    - 💡 Mindset shifts
    - 🔧 Practical applications
    - 🧪 Relevant code or examples I can use

## 🧭 Why this matters to me

This is my way of building long-term memory and clarity while learning from masters. It also helps me stay grounded and reflect on what matters as I go deeper into backend and real-world coding.
